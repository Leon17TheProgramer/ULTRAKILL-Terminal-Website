This is the Ultrakill Terminal as a website, a fan project and a learning device for HTML, CSS and JavaScript!
It's not done at the moment but there are a lot of stuff already like:

Terminals:
1-Main Terminal ~46% (the yellow one, 2.5 out of 5 menus done, planning on making the tip change everytime the user gets the main screen)
2-Cyber Grind's Terminal ~35% (2 out of 4 menus done, planning on making a minigame too)
3-Sandbox's Terminal 99% (almost done, just need to work on audio stuff and track time of how long the user has been on the website)

Menus:
  For Main{
    1-Weapon 98% (just need to work out the buttons and then it'll be 100%)
    2-Enemies 0% (going to start it when I make the icons for each enemy)
    3-The Cyber Grind 100% (it's just the menu to go to the cyber grind's terminal so...)
    4-Sandbox 100% (same logic as the cyber grind)
    5-Options 0% (still thinking on how I would make it since it's not in the game)
  }
  For Cyber Grind{
    1-Play 0% (the minigame previously mensioned)
    2-Themes 100% (maybe I'll do something else, but since there is'nt any 3D arena or anything the buttons don't do anything)
    3-Music 0% (doing other stuff to then do this one)
    4-Patterns 0% (same as Music)
    5-Waves 50% (when I finaly end up making the minigame, the buttons will have functionality, for now they're decoration)
  }
  For Sandbox{
    1-Time of Day 100% (decoration, but you can click on the images)
    2-World Options 100% (proud of this one not gonna lie, made the button toggle between enabled and disabled with the icon going transparent and everything)
    3-Icons 100% (m e l o n)
  }

These are probably the only terminals I'm going to do if anothery terminal type doesnt appear in Ultrakill, though there is going to be a few jokes and secrets to find...
probably a small ammount but jokes and secrets there will be.
Any help would be greatly apreciated as I'm still learning (not only that but confused on how audio works cause I've tried a good few times and it never worked-),
but anyways, enjoy the terminal!
